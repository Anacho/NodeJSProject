# ECE - Internet nouvelle génération - Asynchronous Server Technologies
by Q. Debesson & TA. Le

## How to use

First, you have to have nodejs/npm installed in your computer.
Then, go to the project folder and enter `npm install` and then `chmod u+x bin/*`.

After this, you can run some scripts to populate & init the database:
`bin/initdb`
and then:
`bin/start`
At this moment, the server is on, and you can access it via [localhost](localhost:1889/).
